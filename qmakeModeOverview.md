# Introduction #

When using emacs to create qt specific code, cedet is quite helpful (after some
configurations) but unfortunaltly there is no major mode for highlighting project file.
This is my way of trying to create a major mode for emacs.

# Qt .pro files #

When using qt, one way of creating makefiles is to use qmakes files.
Someday when the mode is done i will give some more information on this.



# qmake-mode #

More information is coming soon
